# Weather API Frontend

This is a simple frontend for the [Weather API](https://github.com/mehmet-f-dogan/weather-api) hosted at https://weather.mehmetfd.dev/api. It allows you to view the current temperature for different cities using a carousel.

## Usage

To use the frontend, simply visit https://weather.mehmetfd.dev and use the carousel to view the current temperature for different cities.

## Development

To develop the frontend, you can clone the repository and open the index.html file in your browser. Note that you'll need to update the `getTemperature` function to use your own API endpoint.
<br>Once you've made the changes, you can open the `index.html` file in your browser to test the frontend. Note that you may need to run a local web server to load the page correctly due to CORS restrictions.
